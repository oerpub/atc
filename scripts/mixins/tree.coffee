# Tree Mixin
# =======
#
# This provides models to behave like a Tree Node.
#
# Features:
# - trickles up events like `tree:add tree:remove tree:change`
# - defers construction of new nodes when they are dropped to the root
# - works when moving from one tree to another
#
# **Note:** Be sure to call `_initializeTreeHandlers` during `initialize`
# **Note:** Instance variables used by this mixin are prefixed with `_tree_`
